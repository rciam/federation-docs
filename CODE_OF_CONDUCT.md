# RCIAM Code of Conduct

## Introduction

This Code of Conduct outlines expectations for contributors to the RCIAM project, fostering a welcoming, inclusive, and collaborative environment for all participants.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism  
- Focusing on what is best for the community  
- Showing empathy towards other community members  

Additional expectations specific to RCIAM:

- **Focus on Security**: Security is central to RCIAM. Contributors are expected to follow best practices, write secure code, and report vulnerabilities responsibly.  
- **Promote Interoperability**: Contributions should align with Identity and Access Management (IAM) standards and protocols, including those outlined by the AARC Blueprint Architecture (AARC BPA). This ensures that RCIAM remains interoperable with other frameworks and services, fostering seamless integration and compliance within federated environments.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances  
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission  
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Our Responsibilities

Community leaders (e.g., RCIAM maintainers and technical leads) are responsible for upholding this Code of Conduct. They are tasked with clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, harmful, or inconsistent with RCIAM's goals of security, privacy, and interoperability.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within RCIAM project spaces (e.g., GitHub repositories, issue trackers) and public spaces when individuals represent the project or community. Examples of representation include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by emailing `faai@grnet.gr`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/), version 2.1.
